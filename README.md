# TurboGenPY
TurboGenPY is a synthetic isotropic turbulence generator for structured grids. It can take in an arbitrary
turbulent energy spectrum and produce a three dimensional vector field (e.g. velocity) whose energy spectrum
matches the input spectrum up to the discrete nyquist limit.

# Supported Spectra
TurboGenPY supports three spectra:
1. CBC (Comte-Bellot, Corrsin)
2. von-Karman Pao
3. Power spectrum
